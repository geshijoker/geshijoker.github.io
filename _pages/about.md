Biography
======
Hi! I'm Ge, a Ph.D. candidate at the [Computer Science Department](https://cs.ucdavis.edu/) in [University of California, Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/). I received my M.S. degree in computer science at the [College of Information and Computer Sciences](https://www.cics.umass.edu/) in [University of Massachusetts, Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/). I received my B.S. degree in Automation from [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/).

Research
======
For my Ph.D., I'm doing research under the supervision of [Prof. Davidson, Ian](https://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/davidson/). I joined Machine Learning and Analytics Group led by [Prof. Mahoney, Michael](https://crd.lbl.gov/divisions/scidata/mla/staff/michael-mahoney/) doing research in loss landscapes and its applications. I did research in the [CV Lab](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/?_ga=2.8406261.13071005.1539107294-754893335.1516127699) working with [Prof. Learned-Miller, Erik](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~elm/papers_by_student.html) on my M.S. project (Video Stabilization via Super Congealing). I worked with [Prof. Zhang, Yu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/zhangyu) on my B.S. project (SLAM: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping).

My research interests include: Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Vision-Language Dual Models, and Large Language Models. My area of expertise is explainable AI and transparent models. Details about my research and projects can be found in the resume below.
