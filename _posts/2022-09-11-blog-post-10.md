<!-- 
Epoch vs Batch Size vs Iterations
======
<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/epoch-vs-iterations-vs-batch-size-4dfb9c7ce9c9">Reference</a>
One Epoch is when an ENTIRE dataset is passed forward and backward through the neural network only ONCE. The batch size is the total number of training examples present in a single batch. Batches are parts of dataset for the big dataset is not able to fits in the memory. Iteration is the total number of training examples present in a single batch. -->

Convert softmax tensors to one-hot representation?
======
```
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functonal as F

x = F.softmax(torch.rand(10, 5))
pred = torch.argmax(x, dim=1)
one_hot_pred = torch.zeros_like(x).scatter_(1, pred.unsqueeze(1), 1.)
```

Good luck!
